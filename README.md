# üêç SnakeGame üêç

Hello there!
This game was made inspired on a YouTube tutorial from [Bro Code.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ/).

The classical snake game was developed using Java language and some libraries to help on the design.

The Snake's color can be easily changed, so as the moving speed and the canvas size.
